# AI-Powered Research Assistant for Academic Literature Review

## Overview

This project aims to develop an AI-powered research assistant designed to streamline the academic literature review process. The assistant will help researchers, students, and academics by providing relevant academic papers, summarizing them effectively, and generating well-structured responses with proper citations.

---

## Problem Statement

Researchers and academics often face the following challenges:

- **Finding Relevant Papers**: Manual searches for academic literature are time-consuming.
- **Understanding Complex Research**: Academic papers are dense and often difficult to summarize.
- **Ensuring Proper Citations**: Correctly citing sources is tedious yet crucial.
- **Efficient Query Resolution**: Existing tools often retrieve papers but donâ€™t provide concise answers.

---

## Objective

To develop an AI-driven research assistant that can:

- Retrieve and summarize relevant academic papers.
- Generate well-structured responses based on the retrieved literature.
- Provide accurate citations to ensure credibility.
- Offer a user-friendly interface for seamless research interactions.

---

## Technology Stack

- **Retrieval**: ChromaDB for document storage and retrieval.
- **Embeddings**: Sentence Transformers for semantic search.
- **LLM**: Llama 2 / Mistral for response generation.
- **Interface**: Streamlit-based web application.

---

## Key Features

- **Academic Citation Handling**: Automatically includes proper citations to ensure credibility.
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Retrieves document chunks and processes them for factually accurate answers.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a clean, intuitive UI built with Streamlit.
- **Scalability**: Can handle a growing database of academic papers and retrieve relevant information efficiently.
- **Performance Optimization**: Uses advanced retrieval techniques and evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) for performance enhancement.

---

## High-Level Architecture

1. **User Query Processing**: Users input queries through the Streamlit UI, and the query is preprocessed.
2. **Document Retrieval & Embedding**: The system retrieves relevant documents using ChromaDB and embeds them using Sentence Transformers.
3. **Response Generation**: The system constructs a structured prompt for the LLM (Llama 2, Mistral) to generate responses, ensuring citations are included.
4. **Citation Post-Processing**: Formats citations properly in APA/MLA/IEEE style.
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly evaluates and refines the system based on precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following dependencies are installed:

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- Sentence Transformers
- ChromaDB
- Llama 2 / Mistral (for LLM-based response generation)
- LangChain (for PDF/Text extraction)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repository.git
    cd your-repository
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

---

## Usage

1. Open the Streamlit web interface in your browser.
2. Input your academic query in the search box.
3. View the summarized response with accurate citations displayed in real-time.

## Challenges & Future Improvements

- **Efficient Information Retrieval**: Constantly refining document chunking and retrieval methods to enhance relevance.
- **Citation Accuracy**: Ensuring precise formatting for various citation styles (APA/MLA/IEEE).
- **Scalability**: Continuously adding new academic papers and optimizing the system for larger datasets.
- **User Feedback**: Implementing user feedback to improve query handling and response quality.
